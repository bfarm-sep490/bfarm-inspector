## 🤝 Contributing

### Local Development Flow
1. Create a new branch for your feature
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit frequently
   ```bash
   git commit -m 'feat: add new feature component'
   git commit -m 'feat: implement feature logic'
   git commit -m 'test: add tests for new feature'
   ```

3. Keep your branch up to date by rebasing with main
   ```bash
   # Update your local main
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main

   # Rebase your feature branch
   git checkout feature/amazing-feature
   git rebase main

   # If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue
   git rebase --continue
   ```

4. Push your branch to GitHub
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```

   If you've rebased your branch and get a push rejection, use force-push:
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```
   
   > ⚠️ **Note**: Use `--force-with-lease` instead of `--force` as it's safer. It will prevent you from overwriting others' work if someone else has pushed to your branch.

### Pull Request Process
1. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
2. Ensure the PR title follows the commit convention
3. Request reviews from team members
4. Address any review comments with new commits
5. Once approved, the PR will be automatically squashed and merged
   - All commits will be combined into one
   - The PR title will be used as the final commit message
   - The commit details will include a co-authored-by credit

### GitHub Repository Settings
- Branch Protection Rules:
  - Require pull request reviews before merging
  - Require branches to be up to date
  - Squash merging enabled by default
  - Commit messages will be automatically formatted based on PR title
